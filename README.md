# pomodora-timer
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking your work or study time into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are called "Pomodoros." The technique is designed to improve productivity and focus by leveraging the idea that people can work more efficiently in short, concentrated bursts. After completing four Pomodoros, you typically take a longer break, around 15-30 minutes.

The Pomodoro Technique helps individuals combat procrastination, manage their time effectively, and maintain their concentration during work. It's a simple and adaptable method that can be used to tackle tasks and projects of various sizes, promoting a sense of accomplishment and reducing burnout.
